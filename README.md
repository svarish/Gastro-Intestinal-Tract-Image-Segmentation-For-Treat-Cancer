**Gastro-Intestinal Tract Image Segmentation for Cancer Treatment**

This repository provides an AI-powered solution for segmenting the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract in medical images (such as CT or MRI scans). It aims to support doctors and researchers in detecting cancerous regions, planning treatments, and improving diagnosis accuracy.

üìä What This Project Does

The Gastro-Intestinal-Tract-Image-Segmentation-For-Treat-Cancer project uses deep learning to analyze medical images of the digestive system and automatically identify and outline key GI organs. This helps oncologists and radiologists by:

Detecting Tumors Early: Automatically highlighting potential cancerous regions.

Planning Radiation or Surgery: Providing precise organ boundaries for treatment planning.

Monitoring Treatment Progress: Comparing scans over time to track cancer response.


Manual segmentation by radiologists is slow and prone to error. This project accelerates the process using AI-powered segmentation.

‚ö° Key Features

Automatic GI Tract Segmentation: Stomach, small bowel, and large bowel regions.

Cancer Treatment Aid: Highlights suspicious or cancerous areas when annotated.

Deep Learning Models: Supports U-Net, Attention U-Net, DeepLabV3+, etc.

Pixel-Level Precision: Outputs masks that clearly separate different organs/tissues.

üí° How It Works

1. Input: Medical imaging data (CT/MRI/endoscopy images).


2. Preprocessing: Image normalization, noise removal, and augmentation.


3. Segmentation Model: A neural network predicts a mask where each pixel is classified as a specific GI region.


4. Output: Color-coded masks showing stomach, small bowel, large bowel, and (optionally) cancer-affected areas.
